### Tuts+ Tutorial: Core Data and Swift: Batch Deletes

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

Core Data is a framework I really enjoy working with. Even though Core Data isn't perfect, it's great to see that Apple continues to invest in the framework. This year, for example, Apple added the ability to batch delete records. In the previous article, we discussed batch updates. The idea underlying batch deletes is very similar as you'll learn in this tutorial.
